## 📖 Project Overview

Educational institutions generate extensive documentation including academic policies, research papers, syllabi, and administrative guidelines. Currently, students, faculty, and administrative staff face difficulties accessing relevant information quickly due to inefficient manual searching processes.

EduAI addresses this problem through an **AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** solution, providing accurate, document-based answers to queries posed by university students, faculty, and administrators.

## 🚀 Features

- **Document Ingestion and Indexing:** Supports PDFs, Word documents, research papers, policies, and FAQs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Provides conversational answers based on semantic search.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Seamlessly integrates with university portals, chatbots, and LMS platforms (e.g., Moodle, Blackboard).
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Supports multiple institutions simultaneously.
- **Plug-and-Play API:** Simple integration into existing university systems.
- **Cloud & On-Premise Deployment:** Flexible deployment options respecting institutional security policies.
